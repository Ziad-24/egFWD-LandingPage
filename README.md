# Project Description 

<p> The aim of this project is to develop javascript skills and use the DOM to access HTML elements dynamically. </p>

<p> When you open the page link you will find an empty page with two buttons, one to create items dynamically and the other is to remove items if exist,
when you press the green button to add items a navbar will pop on the screen with the number of sections in your page , when you click on a specific navigation button the page will automatically scroll you to the section you chose.</p>

<p> The part of the screen you are currently viewing will be highlighed with a light grey color to show which part of the screen you are currently viewing.</p>

# Usage

<p> This project is fully dependant on the JavaScript DOM and allows the user to scroll through the page with dynamic buttons. </p>
<ul>
  <li> <p> The green button 'Add new item' allows you to create items { body section and a navigation bar button } </p>
 </li>
  <li> <p> The red button 'Remove item' allows you to decrease the amount of sections in the page 'if any exists'. </p> 
  </li>
  <li> <p> Pressing on the navigation bar item will lead you to the number of the section you pressed , e.g: pressing on item 2 will lead you to the second section in your page .</p>
  </li>
  <li> <p> When you scroll to the end of the page a light blue button will pop up , if the button is pressed it will direct you to the top of the page.
  </li>
 </ul>
